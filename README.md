This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# CRAM Travel

*CRAM Travel stands for Chris, Robert, Albert, and Max. Also, it's what we had to do for this hackathon*

We participated in a 7 hour long hackathon and this is what were able to make.

## Challenge: Something That Would Help Teens With Independent Travel
We decided to tackle this head-on and attempt to create a "lite" version of a trip planning website. Although we had slightly overestimated our abilities, we knew what went wrong and how it would be fixed the next time around.

## What it does
As of now, we have set up a couple forms and were able to display nearest airports to the customer and to the destination. As for backend, we got directions and hotel locations working.

## How we built it
We used Python Flask to program the backend and React for the frontend.

## Challenges we ran into
Parsing data. The api we used returned a lot of it and it took some time to look through it. Also got confused with a couple CSS properties after not having touched it in a couple weeks.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are proud that we were able to successfully get the data from the API's and correctly format it. 

## What we learned
NEVER put react and flask together its way too annoying trying to call the flask server that's trying to call the API. Next time, static HTML will do and possibly take a look into Bootstrap?

## What's next for The Stock Prophet
Honestly, not much. But it would be cool to have enough time to set up a summary page that can display all the logistics of a possible vacation trip.
